# palko.dev

A personal portfolio built with Astro and TypeScript, featuring a homepage with resume, blog, and bookshelf.

This is just a passion site for me. I'm looking to dive into the world of blogging and writing. I've drawn a lot of inspiritation from Anthony Bourdain, even if his voice and style may not mesh with technical writing. But I don't want this page to only be technical; we'll see what I turn it in to.

I'm not the world's most well-read person, but the books I have read I'm passionate about. You'll find those on my bookshelf, both in this site, and at home.

You'll find my bar cart. I'm interested in spirits, mainly whiskey and red wines. Recently been experimenting with different gins as well.
